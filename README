What can be shown:
1. See method controllers.Results.computeMandates().

 In the beginning, class Results summarizes votes by itself (uses controllers.Results.computeTotalVotes).
 Then I decide to select this value from DB - make use of data.PartyVotesDAO.gotTotalVotes().
 In this case, I need to add this mock to ResultsTest:
 when(Results.partyVotes.gotTotalVotes()).thenReturn(800);

2. ResultsTest:
in the end, I can rename and reorder test-methods, so that they read as a story:
  ResultsTest
  - summarizesAllVotes
  - shares101Mandates  (former totally101MandatesShouldBeShared)
  - accordingToVotes (former computesMandatesAccordingToVotes)
